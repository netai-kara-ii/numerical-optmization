# numerical optimization

Follows from UCL COMP0120 - Numerical Optimization subject, which I took as part of my Computational Finance MSc.

I will leave my courseworks for reference, for anyone interested (marked 80/100 in the first one and 96/100 in the second one).
They may contain a few typos -- ignore them.

## Description

A number of implementations in ```c++```, ```python```, ```cuda``` on numerical optimization techniques.

Any further information will be found in the docs folder.
